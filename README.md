## Git-Hub-Project
    This project Uses GitHub API to get data from users and the followers of that User. 
    I Used React-Class Components to render the UI, Axios to make calls to the API, and I used React state to hold the Data comming back from the API.

* To run the project NPM install dependecies, and NPM Start to start the development server.
